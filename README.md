# [Excel formula for Sublime Text][gh]

Excel formula syntax highlighting for Sublime Text (with some support for
Google Sheets, although currently experimental). Potential future
enhancements include support for OpenOffice Calc and Mac Numbers.

## Installation

[Install][pc-install] via Package Control.

## Usage

1. In Sublime, open or navigate to a `.txt` file containing the Excel
formulae you wish to be highlighted (or create a new file with `CTRL+N`).
2. Activation options:
   - Select the "Excel formula" syntax option from the syntax selection menu at
   the bottom right of Sublime Text.
   - Alternatively, open the Command Palette and type "Excel formula". Select
   the top option ("Set Syntax: Excel formula").
3. Enjoy!
