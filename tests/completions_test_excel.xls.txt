' Desired behavior, when pressing `,` or `DEL` with `[seasonality]` selected:

' Actual behavior:

'A - ${3/.+/, /}
'B - ${3:[opt_param1]}

'A takes the value of 3 ('[opt_param1]'), but the regex forces is to become ', ' since .+ matches the entirity of '[opt_param1]'
'The idea is for this to then be removed if 3: is reduced to a blank string.

'However, deleted parameters need to become ',' when deleted.
